<title>Education Goals</title>

<div class="box">
<p> <font size="5"> More than a year ago, in an email conversation with Dean Litchfield of UIUC, I was asked 'Aman, what is the goal of your education ?' 
And since then I've been on a quest to find an answer to this. The reason this was so hard for me to answer was that I never liked one thing in particular, I like a lot of things a lot.
 I love food : from Indian laal maans to Korean bul go ki to some mashed potatoes. I love technology : from cool web/mobile apps to wondering 'why is that circuit doing that?' 
 I love design : from thinking about why my phone looks the way it does to gazing at nature's simplicity. I love art : from photography that keeps you mesmerized till the time you're late
 for class to the lines that dancers form to no music. I love poetry : from listening to def jam online over and over again to writing my own. I love creation : from a simple website written
 in basic html to create a complex processor for a computer. I love education : from teaching a sibling basic calculus to debating on the purposed of higher education. </font> </p>

<p><font size ="5"> So, my goal is to be a sponge and learn as much as my mind can take in, and then compress all that and take in more. Learn what? Anything. 
Learn how? By doing it. Keep things simple. </font>  </p>
