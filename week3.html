<h3> Week 3 </h3>
<p>This week was a lot of work. Things have started to take off.</p>
<p>Monday:</p> 
<p>It’s time to meet users for HFID. Made a plan to meet users and what we wanted from our interviews. Decided on a list of people to meet. Cold called many places and sounded completely creepy when asking ‘can we study the way you use your cash registers?’</p>
<p>Tuesday: </p>
<p>9 am : Micro Nano; had a debate, some lecture stuff. Debate was a bit weird and did not really pertain to relevant stuff from class. Was glad it was over. 11am: Systems; we were finally given our project for the course. We are to design and build a working scanner for old (like really old) books. The aim is to have digital copies of such books so that they can be made available without harming the original. We discussed for a while and we have our idea on lock. Just gotta do it. 1Pm: Time to go to Providence and see RISD. Took a bus to RISD’s campus. Saw their design studios. Got my PDD team. 2 Babson, 2 Olin, 3 RISD kids. Brainstormed ideas for a project. Narrowed from 300 to 40. Real fun. </p>
<p>Got back, really tired. Had a ideation meeting for HFID at 8. Retired pretty early. </p>
<p>Wednesday:</p>
<p>No classes but full of meetings. Worked on the scanner idea the whole afternoon. Trying to figure out how to make the circuits for it. A real mess. All my knowledge from ECE 110, 210, 290 … seems like a bubble of illusion. They are taught because they are easy to be taught. I was trying to do real work that day-to-day scanners use and I had no idea of what a real circuit involved. I’m starting from scratch. Worked on some PHP/MYSQL dev a little. Liking it a lot. </p>
<p>Thursday: </p>
<p>HFID again. Actually went and met people today. Went to junction ice-cream. A small (really small) ice-cream store in Needham on the train station. Scared the employee there with our questions. Fail! Moved onto to a small gift shop. The lady was really sweet and helped us a lot. Moved to a restaurant called ‘Sweet Tomatoes’. Met the owner and some employees. Heard things we didn’t want. It’s just easier if people ranted about how they hated their cash registers as opposed to ‘Oh! Its wonderful.’</p>
<p>Friday:</p>
<p>Boston time. Left for Boston at noon to meet up with PDD team. 1 person from RISD came over. Had lunch at an amazing place Flour. Did some HFID research there as well. Discussed for 2 hrs to narrow the 40 ideas to 4. Its really hard to get them down to 1. Came back from Boston and did HW and reading. </p>
<p>Saturday and Sunday:</p>
<p>LAZED like no other. Ate homecooked Korean food. Did web dev stuff. </p>
