<p>Week started with Tuesday since Monday was labor day, which comprised of some table tennis, a plan to lose weight, some work on the website, and a tad of reading. </p>
<p> Tuesday was hectic. I had Micro Nano in the morning. We just got bombarded with work for the entire week. There is a discussion on Friday and I’m moderating it. SwEEt Also, we were required to read up on a famous scientist/inventor type person, and guess who I got;
 JOHN BARDEEN, UIUC representing it all around. Plus some fun HW to do. After that, I had systems class. We presented how we fixed the scanner and what we learnt from it. We were taught about layered systems with a beautiful analogy to networking systems. Real fun stuff. Our next awesome assignment, open up the scanner and figure out the layered systems within it. I just can’t wait to start. I had like an hour for lunch, and then off to the ever so famous PDD (Product Design and Development). This course is pure bliss! It’s the perfect amalgamation of DESIGN, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, and ENGINEERING. It’s an interdisciplinary course taught to a class comprising of Olin, Babson, and RISD (Rhode Island School of Design) kids. We get into an awesome group and select a project and build it. We need to learn to figure some distance stuff out because RISD is about an hour and half drive from Olin/Babson (right next door to each other). </p>
<p> **sorry for the time jump** </p>

<p> It’s Sunday and week #2 has not come to an end at Olin. Work has started to really pick up. But for once, I look forward to everyday of class rather than simply shrugging my shoulders and go through the motions. We have made our project proposal for HFID. We wish to redesign how automated cash registered work (only the interface). Real excited about this. We start user research tomorrow on that. It was really nice to open a scanner and see what goes on inside. The tricky part was actually putting it all back together and making sure it still worked. I had to come up with 50 project ideas for PDD. Searched various corners of my brain to meet that mark. </p>

<p> We (all the exchange students) visited Boston yesterday. It was really sweet. Brought some old Harvard memories back. Saw some really nice street performances, rode the famous T, and shopped on the famous Newbury Street. There was also an art show on the harbor , which was pretty cool; saw some glass blowing. Wish we had more time to go whale watching. Leaving that for another time. </p>

<p> There was a party last night too, called Freshman and the 40. Let’s just say we all a nice time. </p>

<p> So much for this week. I do apologize for my grammar and incoherence in these logs. I just don’t have the time to really make proper articles out of these. I shall try to do my best. </p>
