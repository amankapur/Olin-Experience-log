<h3> Week 4 </h3>
<p>Can’t believe it has been a whole month of classes. I just seems like yesterday when I unpacked my suitcase. Days have just been shorter each day. One thing that I’m really learning here is how to really manage time. I spend more than twice the time working outside of classes than in them. No class on Wednesdays but it is probably the most hectic day of the week. Maybe I overloaded, but hard work FTW. </p>
<p>HFID: We have moved on from data gathering to synthesis and analysis. We have our personas, and other design frameworks all postered up on the studio walls. We’re soon about to dive into the real design work. Have a real awesome team. We’re killing it!</p> 
<p>SYSTEMS: So, more was revealed to us this week. Last week we were told to design book readers/scanners to create digital copies of really old books. This week we were told that the scanners, i.e. the users of the book readers, will be prisoners. Really interesting stuff. A small change in context changed our design completely. We made storyboards and refined the whole idea again. The entire systems diagram was reformed. It was like a whole new problem but yet we knew how to get’er done.</p>
<p>PDD: We met with users this week. I interviewed 2 people on crutches and gathered some really useful insight. Had a report to write on the interview process. Submitted it late. A mixup with the deadlines. Things need to start moving with this course soon enough.</p>
<p>MicroNano: This course is starting to get real. We’ve taken the deep dive into semiconductors and what them magical. I don’t think all of us understood what was going on in class, but I know we’ll get it soon enough. We have to deconstruct laptops for next week. This should be really fun, something I’ve always wanted to do and I would have if I had a spare laptop. </p>
<p>I’ve joined a discussion group, “changes in American Higher Education” here. We’re meet once in two weeks to discuss various issues relation to higher education. Last week was all about athletic scholarships. Thanks to some illini sport culture I wasn’t totally lost. Next meeting we’re going to talk about iFoundry and how it’s trying to change the world. I’m supposed to conduct the decision. I got this one. </p>
<p>It was my 20th birthday this Sunday. I was out all weekend. It was really fun. </p>
